# Action

In any application, there are certain operations that are critical to its functionality, such as user authentication, data fetching, or file I/O. These operations often involve multiple steps, error handling, and side effects, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.

The Action Module addresses these challenges by providing a unified way to define, execute, and monitor these complex operations. By wrapping them in `Action` objects, you can:

-   Centralize the logic for each operation in a single place
-   Customize how actions are executed, such as logging their execution times or delegating their work to a backend service
-   Track the progress and status of each action, and handle errors in a consistent way
-   Easily reuse and compose actions across your application

## Defining Actions

To define an action, you create an instance of the `Action` class, specifying its input and output types, as well as a `runner` function that performs the actual work:

```dart
final echoAction = Action<String, String>(
  name: 'echo',
  runner: (input) => input,
);
```

In this example, `echoAction` takes an `input` string, and returns it back.

## Running Actions

To run an action, you simply call its `run` method with the appropriate input:

```dart
final response = await echoAction.run('1234');
print('Fetched response: $response');
```

This will execute the action and return its output (in this case, `1234`), or throw an exception if an error occurs.

## Modifying Actions

Another powerful feature of actions is the ability to compose functionality together to build more complex operations.

```dart
final echoAction = Action<String, String>(
  name: 'echo',
  runner: (input) => input,
)
    .log() // Logs executions of the action using the Log Module
    .analytics() // Not implemented yet, but could integrate with an analytics module in the future
    .onlyForPermissions(Permissions.admin); // Not implemented yet, but could limit it to users with certain permissions
```

While the full potential of actions hasn't been fully tapped yet, there are a variety of avenues to explore with providing more functionality to Actions.

## Usage

The Action Module is already integrated with the Flood toolkit through the [FloodCoreComponent](/pond/core#pre-built-components), so you can start using it right away in your Flood applications.

To customize how actions are executed, you can pass an `actionWrapper` function to `FloodCoreComponent`:

```dart filename="pond.dart"
FloodCoreComponent(
  actionWrapper: <P, R>(action) => action.log(context: corePondContext),
);
```

This will wrap every action executed by Flood with [logging](/logs) behavior, so you can see their executions in the console.
