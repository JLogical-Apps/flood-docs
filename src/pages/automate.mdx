# Automate

The Automate Module is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing CLI automations in your Flood project. By utilizing your existing [CorePondComponent](/pond/core)s, you can create automations that seamlessly integrate with your application's context. For example, the `deploy` automation uses your [Drop](/drop) Repositories to generate Firebase Security Rules, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

## AutomateCommand

At the core of the Automate Module is the `AutomateCommand` class. It represents a CLI command that can be executed with specific arguments and options. To learn how to create a custom one for your project, refer to the [AutomatePondContext](/pond/automate) page.

## Usage

To use the Automate Module in your Flood project, register `AutomatePondComponents` to your `AutomatePondContext`, and then run `Automate.automate(...)` from within the `main` function in the `tool/automate.dart` file. `Automate.automate` will grab the args, find the corresponding `AutomateCommand` to run, parse out the parameters, and run the command.

Here's an example of how to set up the `AutomatePondContext`:

```dart filename="example_core/tool/automate.dart"
final automatePondContext = AutomatePondContext(
  corePondContext: corePondContext,
);

await automatePondContext.register(GreetComponent());

await Automate.automate(
  context: automatePondContext,
  args: args,
  appDirectoryGetter: (coreDirectory) => coreDirectory.parent / 'app',
);
```

In this example, we create an instance of `AutomatePondContext` and pass in the `corePondContext`. We then register a custom [GreetComponent](/pond/automate#automatecommand) using the `register` method.

Once the `AutomatePondContext` is set up, you can run your automate commands using the following command:

```bash
dart tool/automate.dart greet John repeat:3
```

This will execute the `GreetComponent` that you defined and registered.

If you run `automate.dart` without any parameters, it will display a "usage" screen with information about each of the available commands.

```bash
dart tool/automate.dart
```

```
===[Automate Usage]===
greet: Greets the user.
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️️">
    Many of the Pre-Built Modules depend on
    [dcli](https://pub.dev/packages/dcli), which depends on the "dart:cli
    waitFor experiment". The Dart team is slowly [phasing this
    out](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/52121), so you may need to run
    `dart --enable_deprecated_wait_for tool/automate.dart ...` to circumvent
    this for now.

## Pre-Built Modules

The Automate Module includes several pre-built modules that provide additional functionality and automation capabilities:

-   [Release](/automate/release): Manages the release process of your app to app stores and testing frameworks.
-   [Ops](/automate/ops): Automates the deployment of backend resources for your application.
-   [Native Setup](/automate/native-setup): Simplifies the process of creating app icons and splash screens for your Flutter app.
