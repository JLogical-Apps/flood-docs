# Native Setup

Creating app icons and splash screens can be a tedious and repetitive task, especially when dealing with multiple platforms and resolutions. The Native Setup automation aims to streamline this process by providing a convenient way to define your app's branding assets in Dart and automatically generate the required files and configurations.

## Usage

To use the Native Setup automation in your Flood project, follow these steps:

1. Add the `NativeSetupAutomateComponent` to your `AutomatePondContext`:

```dart
await automatePondContext.register(NativeSetupAutomateComponent(
  appIconForegroundFileGetter: (root) => root / 'assets' - 'logo_foreground_transparent.png', // The path to your logo is `project/asset/logo_foreground_transparent.png`
  backgroundColor: 0x172434, // The background color of the splash screen and app icon
  padding: 80, // Padding around the image in the app icon
));
```

In this example, we register the `NativeSetupAutomateComponent` with the `AutomatePondContext`. We provide a function `appIconForegroundFileGetter` that returns the path to the logo file to be used as the app icon foreground. Additionally, we specify the `backgroundColor` and `padding` for the app icon and splash screen.

2. Run the Native Setup automation:

```bash
dart tool/automate.dart native_setup
```

This command will trigger the Native Setup automation, which will generate the necessary app icons and splash screens based on your configuration.

Behind the scenes, the Native Setup automation will handle the creation and configuration of the `flutter_native_splash` and `flutter_launcher_icons` packages for you. It will generate the appropriate `yaml` files and place them in the correct locations within your project.

By utilizing the Native Setup automation, you can easily generate professional-looking app icons and splash screens for your Flutter application. It provides a convenient and efficient way to handle your app's branding assets, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your project.
