# Ops

Managing backend resources for your Flutter app can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with multiple environments and deployment targets. The Ops automation aims to simplify this process by providing a structured and automated way to deploy your backend resources, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring consistency across different environments.

## OpsEnvironment

The `OpsEnvironment` class defines the resources to deploy and the target environment to deploy to. It represents a specific configuration for deploying backend resources. Here are a few examples of `OpsEnvironment`:

1. [`OpsEnvironment.static.firebase` and `OpsEnvironment.static.firebaseEmulator`](/firebase): Targets Firestore Security Rules.

2. [`OpsEnvironment.static.appwrite`](/appwrite): Targets Appwrite Projects and Collection Attributes.

The Ops automation provides a flexible and extensible way to define and configure different deployment environments. You can create additional `OpsEnvironment` implementations to support other backend resources or deployment targets based on your project's requirements.

## Usage

To use the Ops automation in your Flood project, follow these steps:

1. Add the `OpsAutomateComponent` to your `AutomatePondContext` and define the mapping between [environment types](/environment) and `OpsEnvironment`:

```dart filename="example_core/tool/automate.dart"
await automatePondContext.register(OpsAutomateComponent(environments: {
  EnvironmentType.static.qa: OpsEnvironment.static.firebaseEmulator,
  EnvironmentType.static.production: OpsEnvironment.static.firebase,
}));
```

In this example, we register the `OpsAutomateComponent` with the `AutomatePondContext` and define the mapping between environment types and their corresponding `OpsEnvironment`. The `production` environment is mapped to `OpsEnvironment.firebase`, indicating that backend resources will be deployed to the Firebase project. The `qa` environment is mapped to `OpsEnvironment.firebaseEmulator`, indicating that resources will be deployed to the Local Firebase Emulator Suite.

2. Run the Ops automation to deploy your backend resources:

```bash
dart tool/automate.dart deploy production
```

This command triggers the Ops automation to deploy your backend resources to the specified environment, in this case, `production`. The automation will use the corresponding `OpsEnvironment` configuration to determine the deployment target and execute the necessary deployment steps.

Behind the scenes, the Ops automation takes care of generating the appropriate configuration files, such as Firestore Security Rules, based on your Flood project's setup. It then deploys these files to the specified environment, ensuring that your backend resources are properly configured and secured.
