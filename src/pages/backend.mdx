# Backend

Connect to, deploy, and monitor Dart backends easily with Flood. From the `testing` or `device` environment, run your backend locally on the device. On cloud devices, define `ActionRunner`s to define how actions should connect to cloud backend providers, whether an optimistic function should run locally, and how to add analytics and logging.
