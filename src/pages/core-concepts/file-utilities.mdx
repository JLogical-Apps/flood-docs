# File Utilities

Throughout the Flood framework, operator overrides have been implemented for folders and files to simplify the process of defining file paths. These overrides provide a more intuitive and readable syntax, making it easier to work with directories and files.

Instead of using the traditional approach of concatenating strings to create file paths, such as:

```dart
File('${myDirectory.path}/config/settings.json')
```

You can now use the following syntax:

```dart
myDirectory / 'config' - 'settings.json'
```

The `/` operator is used to navigate through directories, while the `-` operator is used to specify a file within a directory.
