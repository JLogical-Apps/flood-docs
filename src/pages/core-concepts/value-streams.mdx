# ValueStreams

ValueStreams are a powerful concept in the Flood toolkit, built upon the foundation provided by the [rxdart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) package. While `rxdart` offers a wide range of utilities for handling streams, it lacks some essential features that Flood addresses. One of the key limitations of `rxdart` is that transforming a `ValueStream` always results in an asynchronous `Stream` instead of another `ValueStream`. Flood extends the functionality of `ValueStream` and `BehaviorSubject` from `rxdart` to provide a seamless way to transform `ValueStreams` into other `ValueStreams`, allowing you to retrieve the value of the stream synchronously.

## FutureValues

Throughout the Flood codebase, you will frequently encounter `ValueStream<FutureValue<T>>`, where `FutureValue` represents the state of a Future, such as `loading`, `loaded`, or `error`. This concept is inspired by the [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) package. A `ValueStream<FutureValue<T>>` essentially means a synchronous stream that tracks the status of a `Future` and how its value changes over time.

## Naming Convention

In Flood, if a function or getter ends with an X, it indicates that it returns a `ValueStream`. For example, `AuthService.static.memory().accountX` returns a `ValueStream` of the currently logged-in Account. You can fetch this value synchronously by calling `authService.accountX.value` to know the current logged-in account, and you can also listen to or map the stream like you would with a regular Stream to make your app reactive.

## Transforming ValueStreams

Flood provides a set of utility functions to transform ValueStreams while preserving their synchronous value access. Here are some of the notable utilities:

1. `mapWithValue`: This method is similar to the standard [map](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Stream/map.html) operator, but it allows you to retrieve the current value of the transformed stream synchronously.

    ```dart
    final mappedStream = valueStream.mapWithValue((value) => value * 2);
    final currentValue = mappedStream.value;
    ```

2. `switchMapWithValue`: This method is equivalent to the [switchMap](https://pub.dev/documentation/rxdart/latest/rx/SwitchMapExtension/switchMap.html) operator, but it maintains the ability to retrieve the current value of the resulting stream synchronously.

    ```dart
    final switchedStream = valueStream.switchMapWithValue((value) => anotherValueStream);
    final currentValue = switchedStream.value;
    ```

3. `asyncMapWithValue`: This method is similar to the [asyncMap](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Stream/asyncMap.html) operator, but it allows you to retrieve the latest value emitted by the stream. However, it's important to note that the async mapper only works when the stream is being listened to.
    ```dart
    final asyncMappedStream = valueStream.asyncMapWithValue((value) async => await someAsyncOperation(value));
    asyncMappedStream.listen((value) {
        final latestValue = asyncMappedStream.value;
    });
    ```

## Combining ValueStreams

Flood also provides utilities to combine multiple `ValueStreams` into a single `ValueStream` while preserving the ability to access the combined value synchronously.

-   `combineLatestWithValue`: This method is similar to the [combineLatest](https://pub.dev/documentation/rxdart/latest/rx/CombineLatestStream-class.html) operator, but it allows you to retrieve the current combined value synchronously.

    ```dart
    final combinedStream = [valueStream1, valueStream2].combineLatestWithValue((values) => values.reduce((a, b) => a + b));
    final currentCombinedValue = combinedStream.value;
    ```

## Awaiting ValueStreams

Flood introduces the `waitUntil` method, which allows you to wait for a specific condition to be met on a `ValueStream`. It returns a `Future` that resolves when the provided predicate function returns `true`.

    ```dart
    final result = await valueStream.waitUntil((value) => value > 10);
    ```

## Converting Futures to ValueStreams

Flood provides the `asValueStream` extension method on `Future`, which converts a `Future` into a `ValueStream` that emits `FutureValue`s representing the current state of the `Future`. This is particularly useful when working with asynchronous operations and wanting to handle their state reactively.

    ```dart
    final futureValueStream = myFuture.asValueStream();
    futureValueStream.listen((futureValue) {
        if (futureValue is FutureLoading) {
            // Handle loading state
        } else if (futureValue is FutureLoaded) {
            // Handle loaded state
        } else if (futureValue is FutureError) {
            // Handle error state
        }
    });
    ```
