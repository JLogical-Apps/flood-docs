# Device Files

The Device Files Module in the Flood framework provides a powerful tool to explore and manage the files on a device directly within the application. It offers a comprehensive file explorer that allows you to navigate through both the storage and temporary directories, providing a convenient way to view, edit, and delete files.

With the Device Files module, you can easily browse through the folder structure of the device, dig into specific directories, and access individual files. The module provides a user-friendly interface to view the contents of files, make modifications, and save the changes. It also includes the ability to delete files, enabling developers to manage the device's file system efficiently.
