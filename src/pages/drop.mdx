# Drop

The Drop Module in the Flood toolkit aims to provide a consistent way to model data, query and update it, and be flexible to change the data source depending on the current environment. It offers a set of tools and components that simplify the process of defining, storing, querying, and updating data entities, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.

## Key Concepts

Drop introduces several key concepts that work together to provide a comprehensive data management solution:

1. **[ValueObjects](/drop/value-objects-and-entities#valueobjects)**: Define the structure and format of your data, including validation rules and constraints.

2. **[Entities](/drop/value-objects-and-entities#entities)**: Represent the fundamental units of data storage, encapsulating ValueObjects with a unique identifier.

3. **[Repositories](/drop/repositories-and-security#repositories)**: Determine where and how Entities are stored, with flexible options for different environments.

4. **[Queries](/drop/queries-and-data-management#queries)**: Provide a powerful mechanism to retrieve and filter data from repositories.

5. **[Security](/drop/repositories-and-security#security)**: Offer granular control over data access and operations.

6. **[Auto-generated UI](/drop/ui-and-hooks#auto-generated-ui)**: Integrate with the [Port Module](/port) to automatically generate user interfaces based on your data models.

7. **[Hooks](ui-and-hooks#hooks)**: Simplify data retrieval and binding in Flutter widgets, with automatic updates when data changes.

## Implementations

Drop supports various repository implementations, including file-based storage, cloud-based storage, and [environment](/environment)-specific storage. However, the `.cloud` modifier on its own does not provide any implementation details. It requires `repositoryImplementations` to be passed into `FloodCoreComponent` to specify the exact implementation of the repositories to use in those environments.

For example, if you pass in [`FirebaseCloudRepositoryImplementation`](/firebase#usage-2) as one of the `repositoryImplementations`, it will make any `.cloud` repositories (or any `.adapting` repositories in a cloud environment) use the Firebase implementation. Similarly, you can provide implementations for other environments or storage mechanisms.

Here's an example of passing repository implementations to `FloodCoreComponent`:

```dart filename="example_core/lib/pond.dart"
await corePondContext.register(FloodCoreComponent(
  repositoryImplementations: (corePondConext) => [
    FirebaseCloudRepositoryImplementation(),
  ],
));
```

By providing the appropriate repository implementations, you can easily switch between different storage mechanisms based on the environment or your application's requirements.

## Use with Pond

To use Drop with Flood:

1. Add the `FloodCoreComponent` to your `CorePondContext` and `FloodAppComponent` to your `AppPondContext`:

```dart filename="example_core/lib/pond.dart"
await corePondContext.register(FloodCoreComponent(
  repositoryImplementations: [
    ...
  ],
));
```

```dart filename="example/lib/main.dart"
await appPondContext.register(FloodAppComponent());
```

2. Register your Repositories to the `CorePondContext` so that Flood knows where to find your data from your queries:

```dart filename="example_core/lib/pond.dart"
await corePondContext.register(UserRepository());
```

By following these steps, Drop will be automatically added to your project, and you can start leveraging its features for data management and querying.

## Debugging

Use the [Debug Module](/debug#drop) to inspect your drop repositories and view the queries that were used to build a page.
