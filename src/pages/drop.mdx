# Drop

The Drop module in the Flood framework aims to provide a consistent way to model data, query and update it, and be flexible to change the data source depending on the current environment. It offers a set of tools and components that simplify the process of defining, storing, querying, and updating data entities, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.

## ValueObjects

`ValueObject`s define the structure and format of the data associated with an `Entity`. They are immutable and consist of a set of behaviors that specify validation rules, fallback values, and other data-related constraints. Here's an example of defining a `ValueObject`:

```dart
class User extends ValueObject {
  late final nameProperty = field<String>(name: 'name').withFallback(() => 'John');
  late final emailProperty = field<String>(name: 'email').isNotBlank();
  late final notesProperty = field<String>(name: 'notes');
  late final itemsProperty = field<String>(name: 'items').list();

  @override
  late final List<ValueObjectBehavior> behaviors = [
    nameProperty,
    emailProperty,
    notesProperty,
    itemsProperty,
    creationTime(),
  ];
}

```

`ValueObject`s can have different behaviors and modifiers to customize their properties:

-   `field<T>()`: A simple behavior that stores a value of type `T`.
-   `reference<EntityType>()`: A field that stores a String but indicates it references an `EntityType`.
-   `computed()`: Computes a value to store in the repository.

Modifiers for behaviors include:

-   `.required()`: Cannot be null. Sets the field to be non-nullable.
-   `.isNotBlank()`: Cannot be null or blank. Sets the field to be non-nullable.
-   `.withFallback()`: If null, uses a fallback. Sets the field to be non-nullable.
-   `.withValidator()`: Adds a `Validator` to the field.
-   `.isEmail()`: Indicates the field must be an email.
-   `.time()`: Parses Strings from the repository into `Timestamp` to be used in the code.
-   `.embedded()`: Required for `field<ValueObjectType>()` so that it can internal data to the `ValueObjectType`.
-   `.list()`: A list of the field type. For example, `field<String>().list()` is a `List<String>`.
-   `.mapTo<ValueType>()`: A map where the field type is the key and `ValueType` is the value type. For example, `field<String>().mapTo<int>()` is a `Map<String, int>`.

## Entities

`Entity`s are the fundamental units of data storage and manipulation. They encapsulate `ValueObject`s along with a unique identifier, providing a way to uniquely represent and manage data records. Entities are mutable, allowing their values to change over time, and they can define lifecycle methods such as `onBeforeSave` and `onAfterDelete` to customize their behavior.

Here's an example of an `Entity`:

```dart
class UserEntity extends Entity<User> {}
```

## Repositories

`Repository`s in Drop define where and how `Entity`s are stored. They provide a flexible and adaptable storage mechanism that can be tailored to your application's needs. Here's an example of defining a `Repository`:

```dart
class UserRepository with IsRepositoryWrapper {
  @override
  late Repository repository = Repository.forType<UserEntity, User>( // Specify the Entity and ValueObject this Repository handles.
    UserEntity.new,
    User.new,
    entityTypeName: 'UserEntity',
    valueObjectTypeName: 'User',
  )
    .adapting('user') // Specifies the path where to save users.
    .withSecurity(RepositorySecurity(
        read: Permission.all, // Anyone can read a user.
        create: Permission.admin, // Only admins can create users.
        update: Permission.authenticated, // Only authenticated users can update users.
        delete: Permission.none, // No one can delete users.
      ));
}
```

`Repository`s have different modifiers to customize their behavior:

-   `.file(path)`: A `Repository` to the device file system at `path`.
-   `.cloud(path)`: A `Repository` to a cloud provider at `path`.
-   `.adapting(path)`: A `Repository` that adapts on the implementation based on the [environment](/environment).
-   `.withSecurity(security)`: Ensures the user has permission to do actions. Otherwise throws an exception.
-   `.withMemoryCache()`: Stores a cache of loaded `Entities` to use before executing a `Query` on the source `Repository`.

These modifiers allow you to configure repositories to adapt to different environments, add security rules, and optimize performance with caching.

### Security

`Repository`s offer security features to control access to data. You can define permission levels for read, create, update, and delete operations, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions on the data.

## Making Updates

Drop provides methods to update and delete `Entity`s in a `Repository`. Here's an example of updating an Entity:

```dart
// This modifies the userEntity's ValueObject by updating its name and email property, then saves it to the repository.
context.updateEntity(
    userEntity,
    (User user) => user..nameProperty.set('John')..emailProperty.set('john@doe.com'),
);
```

And here's an example of deleting an Entity:

```dart
context.delete(userEntity);
```

## Queries

Drop provides a powerful querying mechanism to retrieve data from repositories efficiently. Here are some examples of building queries:

```dart
Query.from<UserEntity>().where(User.emailField).isEqualTo('test@test.com').firstOrNull(); // Fetches the first UserEntities whose email is 'test@test.com' or `null` if not found.
Query.from<UserEntity>().orderByDescending(User.nameField).limit(20).all(); // Fetches the first 20 UserEntities by their name in descending order.
Query.from<UserEntity>().where(User.nameField).isNotNull().paginate(); // Fetches a paginated list of UserEntities whose names are not null.
Query.from<UserEntity>().all().map((userEntities) => userEnitites.map((userEntity) => userEntity.value.nameProperty.value).toList()); // Fetches all UserEntities and maps the resulting UserEntities by their name.
```

## Implementations

Drop supports various repository implementations, including file-based storage, cloud-based storage, and environment-specific storage. However, `.file` and `.cloud` modifiers on their own do not provide any implementation details. They require `repositoryImplementations` to be passed into `FloodCoreComponent` to specify the exact implementation of the repositories to use in those environments.

For example, if you pass in `FirebaseCloudRepositoryImplementation` as one of the `repositoryImplementations`, it will make any `.cloud` repositories (or any `.adapting` repositories in a cloud environment) use the Firebase implementation. Similarly, you can provide implementations for other environments or storage mechanisms.

Here's an example of passing repository implementations to `FloodCoreComponent`:

```dart
await corePondContext.register(FloodCoreComponent(
  repositoryImplementations: [
    FirebaseCloudRepositoryImplementation(),
  ],
));
```

By providing the appropriate repository implementations, you can easily switch between different storage mechanisms based on the environment or your application's requirements.

## Auto-generated UI

Drop integrates with the Port module to automatically generate UI for ValueObjects.

### Generate a Port from a ValueObject

You can generate a Port from a ValueObject using the following code:

```dart
context.find<PortDropCoreComponent>().generatePort(myValueObject);
```

### Overriding

You can customize the generated Port by providing overrides:

```dart
PortGeneratorOverride.remove(field);
PortGeneratorOverride.override(field, portField);
PortGeneratorOverride.update(field, portFieldBuilder);
```

### Using the Auto-generated UI

You can use the auto-generated UI within a `StyledDialog` or `StyledObjectPortBuilder`:

```dart
context.showStyledDialog(StyledPortDialog());
```

or

```dart
StyledObjectPortBuilder(
  valueObject: myValueObject,
  onSubmit: (updatedValueObject) {
    // Handle the updated ValueObject
  },
);
```

The auto-generated UI will automatically fill in initial values based on the passed-in ValueObject, modify the fields to add validators, fallbacks, multiline, date-pickers, color-pickers, etc. The return value from the Port is a reconstructed ValueObject with the values from the UI fields, so you don't have to manually reconstruct everything yourself!

## Hooks

Drop provides hooks like `useQuery` and `useEntity` to simplify data retrieval and binding in your Flutter widgets. These hooks not only fetch the initial data but also automatically update whenever the corresponding entities are modified using the [Model system](/model).

```dart
final userEntitiesModel = useQuery(Query.from<UserEntity>());
final userEntityModel = useEntity<UserEntity>('userId');
```

When you use `useQuery`, it will initially fetch the data based on the specified query. If any entities matching that query are updated, the hook will automatically re-fetch the data and update the widget that uses the hook. This eliminates the need for manual state management and ensures that your UI always reflects the latest data.

Similarly, `useEntity` will fetch a specific entity based on its ID. If that entity is updated, the hook will automatically update the widget with the latest entity data.

By leveraging these hooks, you can greatly simplify your code and reduce the need for explicit state management. Drop takes care of keeping your data in sync with your UI, making it easier to build reactive and data-driven applications.

## Usage

To use Drop in your Flood application:

1. Add the `FloodCoreComponent` to your `CorePondContext` and `FloodAppComponent` to your `AppPondContext`:

```dart filename="pond.dart"
await corePondContext.register(FloodCoreComponent(
  repositoryImplementations: [
    ...
  ],
));
```

```dart filename="main.dart"
await appPondContext.register(FloodAppComponent());
```

2. Register your Repositories to the `CorePondContext` so that Flood knows where to find your data from your queries:

```dart
corePondContext.add(UserRepository());
```

By following these steps, Drop will be automatically added to your project, and you can start leveraging its features for data management and querying.
