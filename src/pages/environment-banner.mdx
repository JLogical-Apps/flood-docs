# Environment Banner

When developing and testing Flutter applications, it's crucial to know which [environment](/environment) you are currently running your code in. The Environment Banner provides a quick and easy way to identify the environment by displaying a banner on the top-right corner of the screen. This banner is visible during development and testing but is automatically hidden in release builds of the app, ensuring that your production app doesn't have an unnecessary "PRODUCTION" banner.

## Usage

If you are using the [FloodAppComponent](/pond/app#pre-built-components) in your Flutter application, the Environment Banner is already implemented and ready to use. Simply run your app in different environments, and the banner will automatically display the corresponding environment name.
