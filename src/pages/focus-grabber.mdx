# Focus Grabber

In modern Flutter applications, user experience is paramount. One common expectation is that clicking on the background of the app should remove focus from the currently-focused input field. This behavior allows users to easily dismiss the keyboard and interact with other parts of the application.

## Usage

If you are using the `FloodAppComponent` in your Flutter application, the Focus Grabber functionality is already implemented for you.
