# Logs

Effective logging is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting applications. The Log Module addresses this need by offering a straightforward way to log info, warnings, and errors using a simple API. For example:

```dart
context.log('User logged in');
context.logWarning('User attempted to access a restricted page');
context.logError('Failed to fetch data from API', StackTrace.current);
```

This module can be easily extended to integrate with popular logging services like [Firebase Crashlytics](/firebase#firebase-crashlytics), DataDog, or Sentry, enabling you to centralize your logging and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior.

## Logging

Logging with the Log Module is as simple as calling the appropriate method on the `BuildContext` or [CorePondContext](/pond/core). The available methods are:

-   `context.log()`: Log an informational message.
-   `context.logWarning()`: Log a warning message.
-   `context.logError()`: Log an error message along with a `StackTrace`.

These methods provide a consistent and intuitive way to log messages throughout your application.

## Log History

The Log Module also supports storing log session history using the `LoggerService`. By adding `.withFileLogHistory()` to a `LoggerService`, you can automatically store log session history in a directory. This feature is particularly useful in cloud [environments](/environment) where you want to persist logs of previous sessions for later analysis, especially in case of crashes or unexpected behavior.

```dart
final loggerService = LoggerService.static.console.withFileLogHistory();
```

## Debugging

To view the logs from the current session and previous sessions, use the [Debug Module](/debug#logs)

## Usage

To start using the Log Module, you need to register a `LoggerService` in the [FloodCoreComponent](/pond/core). Here's an example:

```dart
final floodCoreComponent = FloodCoreComponent(
    loggerService: (corePondContext) => corePondContext.environment.isOnline
        ? LoggerService.static.console.withFileLogHistory(corePondContext.fileSystem.tempDirectory / 'logs')
        : LoggerService.static.console,
);
```
