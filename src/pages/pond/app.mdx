# AppPondContext

The `AppPondContext` is a key component of the Pond module in the Flood framework, designed specifically for building Flutter applications. It extends the functionality of the `CorePondContext` by providing a way to manage and organize `AppPondComponent`s, which are Flutter-specific components that enhance your application's user interface and navigation.

## AppPondComponent

An `AppPondComponent` is similar to a `CorePondComponent`, but it offers additional features tailored for Flutter apps. Like `CorePondComponent`s, `AppPondComponent`s have lifecycle methods for registration, loading, and resetting. However, they also provide extra functionality:

-   `wrapPage`: Allows you to define widgets that wrap around each page in your app. For example, the [EnvironmentBannerAppComponent](/other/environment-banner) uses this to display a banner indicating the current environment on every page.
-   `wrapApp`: Lets you specify widgets that wrap around the entire `MaterialApp`. The [StyleAppComponent](/style) uses this to provide a `Style` to the whole app using a `Provider`.
-   `pages`: A map of `Route`s to their corresponding `AppPage`s, which define the screens in your app and how they are displayed.

## Usage

To start using the `AppPondContext`, create an instance and register your `AppPondComponent`s:

```dart
final appPondContext = AppPondContext();
await appPondContext.register(MyAppComponent());
await appPondContext.register(AnotherAppComponent());

await appPondContext.load();
```

Flood offers a FloodAppComponent that includes a set of essential components for building Flutter apps.

Instead of manually loading the AppPondContext and registering routes, you can use the PondApp.run() method in your main.dart file:

```dart
PondApp.run(
  appPondContextGetter: () => appPondContext,
  // ...
);
```

This will load the `AppPondContext`, register all routes, and navigate to the initial page based on the current URL.

For more information about the available `AppPondComponent`s, see the documentation for each module. You can find descriptions of the smaller utility packages in the [Others](/other) section.
