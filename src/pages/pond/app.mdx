# AppPondContext

The `AppPondContext` is a key component of the Pond Module in the Flood framework, designed specifically for building Flutter applications. It extends the functionality of the [CorePondContexts](/pond/core) by providing a way to manage and organize `AppPondComponent`s, which are Flutter-specific components that enhance your application's user interface and navigation.

## AppPondComponent

An `AppPondComponent` is similar to a `CorePondComponent`, but it offers additional features tailored for Flutter apps. Like `CorePondComponent`s, `AppPondComponent`s have lifecycle methods for registration, loading, and resetting. However, they also provide extra functionality:

-   `wrapPage`: Allows you to define widgets that wrap around each page in your app. For example, the [EnvironmentBannerAppComponent](/environment-banner) uses this to display a banner indicating the current environment on every page.
-   `wrapApp`: Lets you specify widgets that wrap around the entire `MaterialApp`. The [StyleAppComponent](/style) uses this to provide a `Style` to the whole app using a `Provider`.
-   `pages`: A map of [Routes](/path) to their corresponding [AppPages](/pond/app/app-pages), which define the screens in your app and how they are displayed.

## Usage

To start using the `AppPondContext`, create an instance and register your `AppPondComponent`s:

```dart filename="example/lib/main.dart"
final appPondContext = AppPondContext();
await appPondContext.register(MyAppComponent());
await appPondContext.register(AnotherAppComponent());
```

Instead of manually loading the `AppPondContext` and registering routes, you can use the `PondApp.run()` method in your `main.dart` file:

```dart filename="example/lib/main.dart"
PondApp.run(
  appPondContextGetter: () => buildAppPondContext(),
  // ...
);
```

This will build the `AppPondContext`, register all routes, show a splash screen while all the components load, and navigate to the initial page based on the current URL.

## Locating Components

You can locate any `CorePondComponent` or `AppPondComponent` registered within an `AppPondContext` using the `find` method:

```dart
appPondContext.find<HelloWorldPondComponent>() // returns the instance of `HelloWorldPondComponent` registered in the context.
```

If there's a possibility that the component hasn't been registered, you can use the `findOrNull` method instead:

```dart
appPondContext.findOrNull<MyOtherComponent>()
```

## Navigation & Routing

`PondApp.run` uses its own custom router for navigation. To learn more about how `AppPondComponent`s work with Flood's navigation system, check out the [Navigation & Routing](/pond/app/navigation) page.

## Pre-built Components

Flood offers a `FloodAppComponent` that includes a set of essential components for building Flutter apps. Many of the following components are included in both the `CorePondContext` and `AppPondContext`. Some of these components simply register a route in the [Debug](/debug) page.

Here are the components included:

-   [Debug](/debug)
-   [Logs](/logs)
-   [Device Files](/debug/device-files)
-   [Focus Grabber](/focus-grabber)
-   [Auth](/auth)
-   [Drop](/drop)
-   [Reset](/debug/reset)
-   [Firebase Crashlytics](/firebase#firebase-crashlytics)
-   [Port](/port)
-   [Style](/style)
-   [Url Bar](/url-bar)
-   [Environment Banner](/environment-banner)
-   And other minor components that don't currently include documentation.

To use the `FloodAppComponent` within your application, simply register it in your `AppPondContext`.

```dart filename="example/lib/main.dart"
final appPondContext = AppPondContext();
await appPondContext.register(FloodAppComponent(...));
```

If you want to exclude some of these components from your app, simply do not register `FloodAppComponent` and register the components you want to include.
