# App Pages

In Pond, each screen in your app is represented by an `AppPage`. These pages use the [Path module](/path) to determine which page should be displayed based on the current URL.

# AppPage

An `AppPage` is a [HookWidget](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) that consists of several key components:

-   `pathDefinition`: Specifies the route for the page using the Path module's [PathDefinition](/path).
-   `build()`: Defines how the page should be rendered.
-   `redirectTo()`: An optional function that is called before the page is displayed. If this function returns a non-null `RouteData`, the user will be redirected to that page instead of the current one.
-   `getParent()`: Allows you to specify a parent page for the current page. When warping to the page, the parent page will be displayed first, providing a consistent "back" button behavior.

## App Page Wrapper

An `AppPageWrapper` is a way to wrap another `AppPage` and add extra functionality, such as composing redirects and parent pages. This is particularly useful when you want to apply common behaviors or UI elements to multiple pages.

For example:

```dart
class SignupPage with IsAppPageWrapper<SignupRoute> {
  @override
  AppPage<SignupRoute> get appPage => AppPage<SignupRoute>()
        .onlyIfNotLoggedIn() // Redirects the user to the home page if they are logged in.
        .withParent((context, route) => LoginRoute()); // When warping here, show the "LoginRoute" as the parent.

  @override
  Widget onBuild(BuildContext context, SignupRoute route) {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Redirects

Redirects in Pond allow you to asynchronously decide whether to redirect the user to a different `Route` when they try to access the current page. This is handy for cases where you want to prevent access to certain pages based on authentication state or user permissions.

For example, if a user tries to access a profile page but is not logged in, you can use a redirect to send them to the login page instead.

## Parent Pages

Adding a parent to an `AppPage` ensures that when a user navigates directly to that page, the parent page is displayed first. This provides a consistent "back" button behavior across your app.

For instance, if you have a `ProjectDetailsPage` that should always be accessed from the `ProjectListPage`, you can set the `ProjectListPage` as the parent of the `ProjectDetailsPage`. This way, even if a user navigates directly to the `ProjectDetailsPage` URL, they will see the `ProjectListPage` when they click the "back" button.
