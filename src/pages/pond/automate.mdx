# AutomatePondContext

The `AutomatePondContext` is a key component of the Pond Module in the Flood toolkit, designed to facilitate the creation and management of command-line interface (CLI) utilities for your Flutter projects. It extends the functionality of the `CorePondContext` by providing a way to organize and execute `AutomatePondComponent`s, which are components specifically tailored for automation tasks.

## AutomatePondComponent

An `AutomatePondComponent` is similar to a `CorePondComponent`, but it offers additional features focused on automation and efficiency. Like `CorePondComponent`s, `AutomatePondComponent`s have lifecycle methods for registration and loading. However, they also provide the ability to define `AutomateCommand`s, which are the building blocks of your CLI utilities.

## AutomateCommand

An `AutomateCommand` represents a specific task or operation that can be executed from the command line. Each command is composed of several key elements:

-   `name`: The name of the command, which is used to invoke it from the command line.
-   `description`: A brief explanation of what the command does, displayed in the help output.
-   `pathDefinition`: An `AutomatePathDefinition` that specifies how additional segments at the end of the command name should be handled. For example, `dart tool/automate.dart deploy staging` would run the `DeployAutomateCommand` and pass `staging` to the `environmentProperty` based on its `pathDefinition`. `AutomatePathDefinition` is heavily inspired from the [PathDefinition](/path#pathdefinition) from the Path Module.
-   `parameters`: A list of properties that can be set using optional parameters. For instance, `dart tool/automate.dart deploy staging dryrun:true` would set the `dryrun` property to `true` if it is defined as one of the command's `parameters`.
-   `copy()`: A method that creates a new instance of the command.
-   `onRun()`: The method that is executed when the command is invoked.

Here's an example of how to set up an `AutomatePondComponent` with a custom `AutomateCommand` that greets a user a select number of times.

```dart filename="example_core/tool/greet_component.dart"
class GreetComponent with IsAutomatePondComponent {
  @override
  List<AutomateCommand> get commands => [GreetAutomateCommand()];
}

class GreetAutomateCommand extends AutomateCommand<GreetAutomateCommand> {
  late final nameProperty = field<String>(name: 'name').required(); // .required() makes it non-nullable. You know it's non-nullable because it's part of the path itself.
  late final repeatProperty = field<int>(name: 'repeat').withFallback(() => 1); // If `repeat:X` is not in the command, it will fallback to `1`.

  @override
  String get name => 'greet';

  @override
  String get description => 'Greets the user.';

  @override
  AutomatePathDefinition get pathDefinition => AutomatePathDefinition.property(nameProperty);

  @override
  List<AutomateCommandProperty> get parameters => [repeatProperty];

  @override
  Future<void> onRun(AutomateCommandContext context) async {
    final repeat = repeatProperty.value; // repeatProperty.value is non-nullable due to the `withFallback`.
    for (var i = 0; i < repeat; i++) {
      context.print('Hello ${nameProperty.value}');
    }
  }

  @override
  GreetAutomateCommand copy() {
    return GreetAutomateCommand();
  }
}
```

## Usage

To start using the `AutomatePondContext` and its associated `AutomatePondComponent`s, follow these steps:

1. Create an `AutomatePondContext` and register your `AutomatePondComponent`s.
2. Run `Automate.automate(...)` in the `main` function of your `automate.dart` file.

Here's an example of an `automate.dart` file using the custom `GreetAutomateComponent` above.

```dart filename="example_core/tool/automate.dart"
Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  final corePondContext = await getCorePondContext(...);
  final automatePondContext = AutomatePondContext(corePondContext: corePondContext);

  // Register your AutomatePondComponents here
  await automatePondContext.register(GreetComponent());

  await Automate.automate(
    context: automatePondContext,
    args: args,
    appDirectoryGetter: (coreDirectory) => coreDirectory.parent / 'app', // The path to the "App Project"
  );
}
```

With these steps completed, you can now run `dart tool/automate.dart` to execute your `AutomateCommand`s.

For more information about how to run automations, refer to the [Automate Module](/automate) documentation.
