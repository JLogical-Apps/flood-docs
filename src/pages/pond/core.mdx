# CorePondContext

The `CorePondContext` is the foundational component of the Pond module in the Flood framework. It serves as a container and manager for `CorePondComponent`s, which are the building blocks of your application's functionality.

## CorePondComponent

A `CorePondComponent` represents a specific piece of functionality within your application. While `CorePondComponent`s do not add any functionality by themselves, they provide the mechanism for you to add features to your app in a modular and composable way.

Each `CorePondComponent` contains `CorePondComponentBehavior`s that define the component's lifecycle:

-   `onRegister`: Called when the component is registered with the CorePondContext. This is where you should perform any initialization that other `CorePondComponent`s might depend on during their registration.
-   `onLoad`: Called after all `CorePondComponent`s have been registered and the `CorePondContext` is loaded. At this point, you can safely locate and interact with other components.
-   `onReset`: Called when the `CorePondContext` is reset. Resetting should return the application to its initial state, as if it had never been run before.

## Locating Components

You can locate any `CorePondComponent` registered within a `CorePondContext` using the `locate` method:

```dart
corePondContext.locate<MyComponent>()
```

If there's a possibility that the component hasn't been registered, you can use the locateOrNull method instead:

```dart
corePondContext.locateOrNull<MyComponent>()
```

This will return `null` if no component of the specified type is found.

## Lifecycle

A `CorePondContext` follows a specific lifecycle:

1. The context is created.
2. `CorePondComponent`s are registered using the `register` method.
3. Once all components are registered, the `load` method is called, triggering the `onLoad` behavior of each component in the order they were registered.

Loading occurs after registration because some `CorePondComponent`s may need to locate and interact with other components during their loading phase.

You can manually reset the `CorePondContext` by calling the `reset` method:

```dart
corePondContext.reset()
```

This will invoke the `onReset` behavior of each registered component, effectively returning the application to its initial state.

## Usage

To start using the `CorePondContext`, simply create an instance and register your desired `CorePondComponent`s:

```dart
final corePondContext = CorePondContext();
await corePondContext.register(MyComponent());
await corePondContext.register(AnotherComponent());

await corePondContext.load();
```

Flood provides a `FloodCoreComponent` that includes a set of essential components you can use to quickly set up your application.

For more information about the available components, see the documentation for each module. You can find descriptions of the smaller utility packages in the Others section.
