# CorePondContext

The `CorePondContext` is the foundational component of the Pond Module in the Flood toolkit. It serves as a container and manager for `CorePondComponent`s, which are the building blocks of your application's functionality.

## Lifecycle

A `CorePondContext` follows a specific lifecycle:

1. The context is created.
2. `CorePondComponent`s are registered using the `register` method.
3. Once all components are registered, the `load` method is called, triggering the `onLoad` behavior of each component in the order they were registered.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    When using a `CorePondContext` in the context of a Flutter App or
    Automation, it will automatically handle loading your `CorePondContext`.
    There is no need to manually call this yourself.
</Callout>

While resetting is typically handled by the [Reset Debug Module](/debug/reset), you can manually reset the `CorePondContext` by calling the `reset` method:

```dart
corePondContext.reset()
```

This will invoke the `onReset` behavior of each registered component, effectively returning the application to its initial state as if it was never installed.

## CorePondComponent

A `CorePondComponent` represents a specific piece of functionality within your application. While `CorePondComponent`s do not add any functionality by themselves, they provide the mechanism for you to add features to your app in a modular and composable way.

### CorePondComponentBehavior

Each `CorePondComponent` contains `CorePondComponentBehavior`s that define the component's lifecycle:

-   `onRegister`: Called when the component is registered with the `CorePondContext`. This is where you should perform any initialization that other `CorePondComponent`s might depend on during their registration.
-   `onLoad`: Called after all `CorePondComponent`s have been registered and the `CorePondContext` is loaded. At this point, you can safely locate and interact with other components.
-   `onReset`: Called when the `CorePondContext` is reset. Resetting should return the application to its initial state, as if it had never been run before.

Here's an example of a `CorePondComponent` that simply stores some state you can use across your app.

```dart filename="example_core/lib/features/hello_world.dart"
class HelloWorldPondComponent extends CorePondComponent {
  String? name;

  @override
  List<CorePondComponentBehavior> get behaviors => [
        CorePondComponentBehavior(
          onLoad: (context, component) => name = 'John Doe',
        )
      ];

  String greet() {
    return 'Hello ${name ?? 'N/A'}';
  }

}
```

Here's how you would register it to your `CorePondContext`.

```dart filename="example_core/lib/pond.dart"
final corePondContext = CorePondContext();
await corePondContext.register(HelloWorldPondComponent());
```

## Locating Components

You can locate any `CorePondComponent` registered within a `CorePondContext` using the `locate` method:

```dart
corePondContext.locate<HelloWorldPondComponent>() // returns the instance of `HelloWorldPondComponent` registered in the context.
```

If there's a possibility that the component hasn't been registered, you can use the `locateOrNull` method instead:

```dart
corePondContext.locateOrNull<MyOtherComponent>()
```

This will return `null` if no component of the specified type is found.

## Pre-Built Components

Flood provides a `FloodCoreComponent` that includes a set of essential components you can use to quickly set up your application.

Here are the components included:

-   [Type](/type)
-   [Environment](/environment)
-   [Logs](/logs)
-   [Drop](/drop)
-   [Auth](/auth)
-   [Action](/action)
-   And other minor components that don't currently include documentation.

To use the `FloodCoreComponent` within your application, simply register it in your `CorePondContext`.

```dart filename="example_core/lib/pond.dart"
final corePondContext = CorePondContext();
await corePondContext.register(FloodCoreComponent(...));
```

If you want to exclude some of these components from your context, simply do not register `FloodCoreComponent` and register the components you want to include.
