# Port

When building forms in Flutter, developers often encounter challenges such as manual form definition, validation logic, and UI consistency. The Port module addresses these pain points by providing a powerful API for defining form structures, handling validation, and automatically generating user interface components.

## Core Concepts

### Port

A `Port` represents the definition of a form. It serves three primary purposes:

1. Defining the fields of the form.
2. Validating the form data.
3. Transforming and returning the form values.

Here's an example of creating a `Port`:

```dart
final port = Port.of({
  'name': PortField.string().isNotBlank(),
  'email': PortField.string().isNotBlank().isEmail(),
});
```

In this example, the `Port` defines two fields: "name" and "email". The "name" field is a non-blank string, while the "email" field is a non-blank string that must be in a valid email format.

### Fields

The Port module provides a set of default `PortField` types to cover common form field scenarios:

-   `PortField.string()`: Represents a non-nullable String field.
-   `PortField.dateTime()`: Represents a DateTime field.
-   `PortField.option(options)`: Allows selecting a value from a predefined list of options.
-   `PortField.port(port)`: Embeds another `Port` as a field, enabling nested form structures.
-   `PortField.stage(options, portMapper)`: Provides a list of options and maps each option to a specific `Port`, allowing dynamic form stages based on user selections.

You can further customize `PortField`s by applying modifiers to add validation rules or transform the field data. Some common modifiers include:

-   `.isNotNull()`: Ensures the field value is not null.
-   `.isNotBlank()`: Ensures a String field is not null or blank.
-   `.isEmail()`: Validates that a String field is in a valid email format.
-   `.withFallback(fallback)`: Specifies a fallback value to use if the field value is null.
-   `.map(mapper)`: Transforms the field value using a provided mapper function.
-   `.withValidator(validator)`: Adds a custom validation rule using a `Validator` function.

### Submitting and Validating

Once you have defined your `Port` and its fields, you can submit the form and validate the results. Here's an example of how to submit a `Port` and handle the validation results:

```dart
final port = Port.of({
  'name': PortField.string().isNotBlank(),
  'email': PortField.string().isNotBlank().isEmail(),
});

port.setValue(name: 'name', value: 'John Doe');
port.setValue(name: 'email', value: 'john@test.com');

final result = await port.submit();
result.isValid // true
result.data['name'] // 'John Doe'
```

### Transforming Data

By default, a `Port` returns a `Map<String, dynamic>` containing the field names as keys and their corresponding values. However, you can transform the form data into a custom object using the `.map(mapper)` modifier. This allows you to create a `Port` that returns a specific type, making it more convenient to work with the form results.

## Flutter Integration

The Port module seamlessly integrates with Flutter, providing widgets and builders to simplify the rendering and management of form fields within your application.

### PortBuilder

The `PortBuilder` widget listens to the values of a `Port` and rebuilds its child widgets whenever the form data changes. It provides access to the current state of the `Port`, allowing you to build custom widgets based on the form values.

```dart
PortBuilder(
  port: port,
  builder: (Port port) {
    // Build widgets based on the Port values
  }
)
```

### PortFieldBuilder

The `PortFieldBuilder` widget focuses on a specific `PortField` within a `Port`. It listens to the value of the field and rebuilds its child widget whenever the field value changes. This is particularly useful for building custom field widgets or displaying field-specific error messages.

```dart
PortFieldBuilder(
  fieldName: 'name',
  builder: (context, portField, value, error) {
    return StyledText.body(value ?? 'Error: $error');
  }
)
```

## Auto-generated UI

The Port module takes form development to the next level by providing the ability to automatically generate user interface components based on a `Port` definition. This feature significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to build form screens and ensures a consistent look and feel across your application.

The auto-generated UI considers the different `PortField` types, their modifiers, and any additional metadata provided. It intelligently maps each field to an appropriate UI component based on its type and characteristics. For example:

-   `PortField.string()` is rendered as a text input field.
-   `PortField.int()` is rendered as a text input field with int validation.
-   `PortField.dateTime()` is rendered as a date picker.
-   `PortField.option(options)` is rendered as a dropdown.
-   `PortField.stage(options, portMapper)` is rendered as a multi-step form, where the user can select an option and dynamically load and view the corresponding `Port` UI.

The auto-generated UI also takes into account the modifiers applied to the fields. For instance:

-   `.isNotNull()` adds a required field indicator.
-   `.isEmail()` applies email validation and displays an error message if the entered value is not a valid email address.
-   `.isSecret()` masks the input as a password field.
-   `.multiline()` renders a multiline text input field.
-   `.color()` renders a color picker instead of a regular text input.

Additionally, any display names, hints, or custom metadata provided through modifiers like `.withDisplayName()` and `.withHint()` are incorporated into the generated UI to enhance usability and clarity.

The auto-generated UI aims to provide a functional and visually appealing form layout out of the box, saving developers time and effort in building form screens manually. However, it also offers flexibility through overrides and customization options, allowing developers to fine-tune the generated UI to match their specific design requirements.

### Rendering a Port

You can render a `Port` in various ways:

-   As a dialog: Use `context.showDialog(StyledPortDialog(port: port))` to display the form fields in a dialog window. You can override the `onAccept` callback to customize the behavior when the user submits the form.
-   As a widget: Use `StyledObjectPortBuilder(port: port)` to render the form fields as a widget within your application.

### Overrides

If you need to customize the appearance or behavior of specific form fields, you can provide overrides and define the order of the generated widgets. This allows you to fine-tune the auto-generated UI to match your application's design and requirements.

```dart
StyledObjectPortBuilder(
  port: userPort,
  order: [
    User.nameField,
    User.emailField,
  ],
  overrides: {
    User.nameField: StyledTextPortField(
      fieldName: User.nameField,
      labelText: 'OVERRIDE',
    ),
  }
),
```

## Usage

To start using the Port module in your Flood application:

1. Define your form structure using `Port` and `PortField`.
2. Use `PortBuilder` and `PortFieldBuilder` to build custom form widgets if needed.
3. Render the form using `StyledPortDialog` or `StyledObjectPortBuilder` for auto-generated UI.
4. Handle form submission and validation results to process the form data.

With the Port module, you can effortlessly create dynamic and validated forms while maintaining a clean and consistent user interface throughout your Flutter application.

For more advanced use cases and detailed examples, refer to the Port API documentation and explore the sample code provided in the Flood framework repository.
