These updates bring significant improvements to asset management, offline capabilities, and user interface components, enhancing both developer experience and application performance.

## Major Changes

### [Asset Module](/asset)
- Introduced the Asset Module for saving, retrieving, securing, selecting, and synchronizing assets across all environments.
- Implemented environment-specific asset storage: memory for `testing`, device file system for `device`, and cloud provider's asset storage for other environments.
- Added configurable `AssetProvider`s for accessing and uploading assets:
    - Customizable asset paths based on entity IDs.
    - Flexible security rules, including custom rules and inheritance from Drop `Repository` security.
    - In-memory caching with `.withCache()` and on-device caching with `.withDeviceCache()`.

- Integrated [Firebase Storage](/firebase#firebase-storage) for assets in Firebase projects.
- [Automated generation and deployment](/firebase#automatic-firebase-storage-security-rules-generation-and-deployment) of Firebase Storage security rules based on registered `AssetProvider`s.

### [Drop Module](/drop)
- Improved [RepositorySecurity](/drop/repositories-and-security#security) with more robust field value checks.
- Added [asset support to ValueObjects](/asset#using-assets-in-valueobjects) with `field<String>(name: ...).asset(assetProvider: ...)`.
- Enhanced [reference fields](/drop/ui-and-hooks#reference-fields) with dropdown selection and customizable queries.
- Introduced `Repository.syncing(...)` for [offline-first applications](/drop/repositories-and-security#offline-first-with-syncing-repositories):
    - Device-based caching of query results.
    - Offline updates with automatic syncing when online.
    - Added `SyncIndicator` widget for visualizing sync status.

- Implemented [cascading asset deletion](/asset#asset-lifecycle-management) when removing ValueObjects containing assets.

## Minor Changes

### [Auth Module](/auth)

- Added `Repository.environmental(...)` and `Repository.adaptingToDevice(...)` for environment-specific repositories.
- Updated repository security to not modify queries automatically.
- Added [`useSingleton(Query)`](/drop/ui-and-hooks#hooks) and [`useFutureQuery(Query)`](/drop/ui-and-hooks#hooks) hooks.

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade your project to Flood v4.1, follow these steps:

1. Update the `flood`, `flood_core`, and `flood_cli` dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` files to `v4.1`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flood: # flood_core, and flood_cli
       git:
         url: # Do not change
         ref: v4.1 # <-- Change this from v4.0 to v4.1
         path: # Do not change
   ```
   
2. Run the following command to update dependencies and rebuild your project:
    ```bash
    melos bs
    ```
3. There will be some breaking changes regarding `FlutterFileRepositoryImplementation`, setting values based off the `name` of `Port`s, and a dependency clash. These changes are really simple to resolve. Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/JLogical-Apps/flood-example/commit/02a108a98eb12307e434e9fcbcc6392f54b20ec5) as a reference for how the example project upgraded from v4.0 to v4.1.
