These updates bring significant improvements to app styling, user input, and data management, enhancing both developer productivity and application performance.

## Major Changes

### Dynamic Styling

-   Added ability to dynamically style your app at runtime by setting `context.styleAppComponent.style` to a [Style](/style).
-   Introduced `styleLoader` in `FloodAppComponent` for asynchronous style loading. This can be used to asynchronously load light or dark theme based on the currently logged-in user's preferences.

### Text Input Suggestions

-   Added dynamic text suggestions which enhances the user input experience with clickable suggestions. Suggestions can be accessed by one of the following: [StyledTextField](/style/input#styledtextfield), [PortField](/port#fields), or [ValueObject fields](/drop/value-objects-and-entities#valueobjects).

    ```dart
    // Highly customizable from within the UI
    StyledTextField(
      suggestionsGetter: (currentText) async {
          /* Fetch suggestions here */
      },
    )

    // from within a Port
    PortField.string().withSuggestions((value) async {/* Fetch suggestions here */})

    // from within a ValueObject
    static const stateField = 'state';
    late final stateProperty = field<String>(name: stateField)
         .withDisplayName('State')
         .withSuggestions((context, value) async {/* Fetch suggestions here */});
    ```

-   Implemented customizable suggestion behaviors, including debounce duration and widget builders.

### Improved Reference Fields

-   Enhanced reference fields in [ValueObject Ports](/drop/ui-and-hooks#reference-fields) by adding a search dialog for easier entity selection.

### Asset Compression

-   Introduced automatic [image and video compression for AssetProviders](/asset#asset-compression), which optimizes storage usage and bandwidth consumption for uploaded assets by simply adding `.withCompression()` to an AssetProvider.
-   To use `.withCompression()` in your Flood app, add the following configuration:

```dart filename="example/lib/main.dart" {5}
FloodAppComponent(
  ...,
  assetProviderImplementations: (corePondContext) => [
    ...,
    FlutterCompressionAssetProviderImplementation(),
  ],
),
```

### Firebase Integration Enhancements

-   Added [FirebaseDropAutomateComponent](/automate/firebase-drop) with new `drop_functions` command, which automatically generates TypeScript definitions for [Repositories](/drop/repositories-and-security#repositories) and [ValueObjects](/drop/value-objects-and-entities#valueobjects). This improves type-safety and productivity when working with Firebase Functions.
-   To use, simply add the following configuration to the [AutomatePondContext](/pond/automate.mdx):

```dart filename="example_core/tool/automate.dart"
await automatePondContext.register(FirebaseDropAutomateComponent());
```

## Minor Changes

-   Introduced `Query.getSingleton` for efficient handling of unique entities.
-   Resolved issues related to Flutter web compatibility.
-   Fixed bugs in the offline-sync module to improve reliability.

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade your project to Flood v4.2, follow these steps:

1. Update the `flood`, `flood_core`, and `flood_cli` dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` files to `v4.2`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        flood: # flood_core, and flood_cli
            git:
                url: # Do not change
                ref: v4.2 # <-- Change this from v4.1 to v4.2
                path: # Do not change
    ```

2. Run the following command to update dependencies and rebuild your project:

    ```bash
    melos bs
    ```

3. There aren't any breaking changes! Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/JLogical-Apps/flood-example/commit/61393fbef158472d2908091686aecfcc1e78354c) as a reference for how the example project upgraded from v4.1 to v4.2.
