# Share

The Share Module provides an easy way to share text or files across different platforms. It's automatically included in the `FloodAppComponent`.

## Usage

Access the Share module using `BuildContext.shareAppComponent`.

### Sharing Text

Use `shareText` to share text content:

```dart
await context.shareAppComponent.shareText(
  context,
  text: 'Hello, World!',
);
```

-   Mobile: Opens the native share sheet
-   Web: Copies the text to the clipboard

### Sharing Files

Use `shareFile` to share files:

```dart
await context.shareAppComponent.shareFile(
  context,
  fileName: 'report.pdf',
  fileBytes: pdfBytes,
  mimeType: 'application/pdf',
);
```

-   Mobile: Opens the native share sheet with the file
-   Web: Triggers a download of the file

Both methods adapt their behavior based on the current platform, providing a seamless sharing experience in mobile and web applications.

## Usage

If you are using the [FloodAppComponent](/pond/app#pre-built-components) in your Flutter application, the Share functionality is already implemented for you.
