# StyledList

Allows for the composition of attributes for columns and rows, making it easy to create well-structured and visually appealing lists.

For example, instead of:

```dart
Scrollbar(
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    physics: BouncingScrollPhysics(),
    child: Center(
      child: MasonryGridView.count(
        padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
        shrinkWrap: true,
        crossAxisCount: max(MediaQuery.of(context).size.width ~/ list.childMinSize!, 1),
        mainAxisSpacing: 4,
        crossAxisSpacing: 4,
        physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
        itemCount: children.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, i) => children[i],
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

You can use:

```dart
StyledList
    .column // Defines this as a column instead of a row.
    .centered // Centers all widgets on the main axis.
    .withScrollbar // Makes it scrollable and adds a scrollbar.
    .withMinChildSize(250)( // Creates a grid where each item has a minimum width of 250.
        children: [...] // The children of the StyledList.
)
```

Here are the bases you can use:

-   `StyledList.row`: Aligns items in a row.
-   `StyledList.column`: Aligns items in a column.

Here are the modifiers you can use:

-   `.scrollable`: Makes the list scrollable.
-   `.withScrollbar`: Makes the list scrollable and also includes a `StyledScrollbar`.
-   `.centered`: Centers the items on the cross-axis.
-   `.shrink`: Makes the main-axis as small as possible.
-   `.withMinChildSize()`: Converts the list into a [masonry grid](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_staggered_grid_view#masonry) where each child has a minimum width, but expands to fill the available space.
