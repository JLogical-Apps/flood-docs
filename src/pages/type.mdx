# Type

In many programming languages, you can simply provide a `Type` and have the language generate a new instance of that `Type` using reflection. However, Dart does not include the ability to instantiate types during runtime to keep the generated programs lean and efficient. The `Type` module in the Flood toolkit addresses this limitation by introducing `RuntimeType`s, which allow you to define and instantiate types dynamically.

## Context

To start using the `Type` Module, you first need to create a `TypeContext`. This context stores information about every `Type` you want to instantiate, including the types it extends and how to instantiate the type (if it's not abstract).

Here's an example of setting up a `TypeContext`:

```dart
final context = TypeContext();
context.registerAbstract<MyAbstractClass>(name: 'MyAbstractClass');
context.register<MyConcreteClass>(MyConcreteClass.new, name: 'MyConcreteClass', parents: [MyAbstractClass]);
```

Note that you need to specify a `name` for each of the `Type`s. This is crucial when Dart is compiled to web and minified, as the names of the `Type`s can be jumbled up. Specifying a name ensures that you can create an instance of a `Type` based on its name, like this:

```dart
context.getByName('MyConcreteClass').createInstance();
```

For concrete classes, you also need to specify how to generate new instances. In the example above, a new instance of `MyConcreteClass` is created using `MyConcreteClass.new` (Dart syntax sugar for `() => MyConcreteClass()`).

## RuntimeTypes

The `Type` module exports the `RuntimeType` class, which contains information about a single `Type`, such as how to instantiate it, its parents or children, and whether it is abstract.

Once you register a `Type` using a `TypeContext`, you can retrieve its `RuntimeType` using one of the following methods:

```dart
myConcreteRuntimeType = context.getRuntimeType<MyConcreteClass>();
myConcreteRuntimeType = context.getRuntimeTypeRuntime(MyConcreteClass);
myConcreteRuntimeType = context.getByName('MyConcreteClass');
```

Here's how you can access information from a `RuntimeType`:

```dart
myConcreteRuntimeType.getAncestors() // [RuntimeType<MyAbstractClass>]
myConcreteRuntimeType.getChildren() // []
myConcreteRuntimeType.getDescendants() // []
myConcreteRuntimeType.isA(myAbstractRuntimeType) // true
```

## Generating Instances

There are two ways to generate an instance of a `RuntimeType`:

1. Using the `createInstance()` method on the `RuntimeType` itself:

```dart
myConcreteRuntimeType.createInstance();
```

2. Using the `construct()` method on the `TypeContext`:

```dart
typeContext.construct(MyConcreteClass);
```

Note that attempting to create an instance of an abstract `RuntimeType` will throw an error.

By leveraging the `Type` module in the Flood toolkit, you can effectively manage and instantiate runtime types in your Dart and Flutter applications. This enables dynamic type creation while maintaining the efficiency and performance benefits of Dart's design philosophy.

## Use with Pond

The Type Module is automatically registered when you use the [FloodCoreComponent](/pond/core#pre-built-components). You can extract the `TypeContext` from the `CorePondContext` like so:

```dart
final typeContext = corePondContext.locate<TypeCoreComponent>();
```
