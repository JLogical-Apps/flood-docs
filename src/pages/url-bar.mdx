# Url Bar

When developing mobile applications, testing and navigating to different pages can be a challenging task, especially when working with a mobile view. Emulating and navigating to specific pages often requires the use of a physical device or an emulator, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome.

The Url Bar component in Flood addresses this issue by providing a simple and intuitive way to navigate to different pages directly from your mobile device. By long-pressing on the bottom-left of the screen, you can reveal the app bar and enter the desired url to navigate to.

## Usage

Using the Url Bar component in Flood is straightforward. When you add `FloodAppComponent` to your [AppPondContext](/pond/app), the Url Bar component is automatically included.
